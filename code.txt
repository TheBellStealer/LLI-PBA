  <h2 align="center">What is Ancient Egypt?</h2>
  <p>Ancient Egypt was a civilization of ancient North Africa, concentrated along the lower reaches of the Nile River, situated in the place that is now the country Egypt. The success of ancient Egyptian civilization came partly from its ability to adapt to the conditions of the Nile River valley for agriculture. If you want to learn more information on Ancient Egypt, you can watch <a href="https://youtu.be/Z3Wvw6BivVI">this video</a>.</p>

<h2 align="center">Egyptian Contributions</h2>
  <p>The Egyptians had many contributions to the current day lifestyle. They invented many things that we use today like mathematics, geometry, surveying, metallurgy, astronomy, accounting, writing, paper, medicine, the ramp, the lever, the plough, mills for grinding grain and all the parapernalia that goes with large organised societies</p>

<h2 align="center"> Gender Issues</h2>
  <p>There are many gender issues around right now, a lot of troubles about gender inequality keep springing up in the news. But did you know that these gender inequality issues were also present in Ancient Egypt? That's right, even in the old days when it was Pharohs and Sphynxes and mummification there were gender issues roaming around the place</p>
  
  <br>
  
  <p>Gender Issues in Egypt weren't such a large problem. Most Women had Men's rights when it came to legal things like owning property and even living alone, they could even have their own businesses and had the right to divorce. Though the right changed as Egypt's kingdoms did the same, women could still do as they please in the New Kingdom. Being able to sell and buy property without a man's consent</p>
  
  <p> It's pretty safe to say that Egyptian Women were treated well. They had almost the same rights and even had tons of respect from those around them.</p>

  <p>During the era of Egyptian Civilization, there wasn't a lot of gender inequality. Women could start their own business, claim their own land and work, but they were still treated unequally in other things like politics. Ancient Egypt was mostly ruled by men with only six women who ruled egypt, and those who had influencial possitions earned the spot through relationships with men.</p>

  <p>Impact: Gender inequality has a profound effect on mental health worldwide. Some of the psychological effects of gender inequality include higher levels of stress, anxiety, depression, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in women and people of marginalized genders.</p>

  <p>Causes: Uneven access to education, lack of employment equality, job segregation, lack of legal protections, lack of bodily autonomy, poor medical care, lack of religious freedom, lack of political representation, racism, and societal mindsets</p>

<h3 align="center"> Root Causes of Gender Inequality</h3>
  <p>Reasons for inequalities are numerous; social norms and attitudes, economic pressures, religious beliefs, and structural forces all help maintain the status quo.</p>

<h3 align="center">Effects of Gender Inequality</h3>
  <p>Gender inequality has been an important issue in Egypt for centuries. There are many organizations that recognize how important gender inequality in Egypt is for the economic growth and development of the country. There are many forms of gender inequality that are expressed daily, such as the limitations on women in economic participation, sexual harassment, gender-based violence and unequal access to education.

<h3 align="center">Solutions</h3>
  <p>USAID works in partnership with the Government of Egypt to reduce gender gaps across a wide range of sectors and activities, including removing constraints to women’s economic participation; addressing sexual harassment and gender-based violence; and reducing the gender enrollment gap at all levels of education – including improving access for girls to Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) education.
